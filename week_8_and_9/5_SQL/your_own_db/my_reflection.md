** My own database challenge-- Reflection **

* For this challenge it was extremely useful to get some more practice writing databases from scratch as well as manipulating information inside those databases. After not working on SQL for about a week, it took me a bit of time to remind myself of the different SQL statements to create and add values to a database. After a little while though I was adding and modifying content with ease! I could still use more practice with the different JOINS, as well as the GROUP BY and HAVING keywords, but I'm sure that will just come with time. Overall I found this challenge to be very enjoyable because it was great to get more SQL practice, and didn't find much of it to be tedious because I was learning a whole lot that I had missed my first time around with SQL.
