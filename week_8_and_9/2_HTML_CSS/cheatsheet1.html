  <h2>Object Literal Notation</h2>
    <p>
    An object is declared using literal notation by: </br>
      <span class='code'>
      var person1 = { </br>
        name: "Andra", </br>
        age: 26, </br>
        location: "San Francisco" </br>
      } </br>
      </span></br>
      Literal notation is best used when you have a lot of different objects, or don't require a lot of behaviour associated with your object, i.e. it is just a container for data.
      In this example, name, age, and location are known as properties of the person1 object, and "Andra", 26, and "San Francisco" are the values of those 
      properties.
    </p>
  <h2> Constructor Notation</h2>
    <p>
      An object is declared using constructor notation by: </br></br>
      <span class='code'>
      var person2 = new Object();<br>
      person2.name = "Jake"; <br>
      person2.age = "25";<br>
      person2.location = "San Francisco";<br>
      </span> <br>
      Constructor notation is best used when you have a large number of objects that need to be instantiated or modified in some way. Or if you need multiple instances of that same object.
      In this example, name, age, and location are still properties of the person2 object, but are accessed using dot notation.
    </p>
  <h2>Accessing Object Properties</h2>
    <p>
      There are two different ways to access an object's properties in Javascript.<br>
      The first is bracket notation: <br><br>
      <span class='code'>
      person1["name"] ==> output: "Andra"<br>
      </span><br>
      The second is dot notation: <br><br>
      <span class='code'>
      person2.name ==> output: "Jake"   
      </span><br>
    </p>
  <h2>Declaring and Accessing Object Methods</h2>
      <h4>Declaring Function using dot notation:</h4><br>
    <p>
      <span class='code'>
      person2.prototype.print_info = function(){ 
        console.log('My name is ' + this.name + ', I am ' + this.age + ' and live in ' + this.location.' )
      }
      </span><br><br>
    </p>
      <h4>Accessing Object Method</h4><br>
    <p>
      <span class='code'>
        person2.print_info() ==> output: 'My name is Jake, I am 25 and live in San Francisco.'
      </span>
    </p>
